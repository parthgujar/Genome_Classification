Image Segmentation for DNA classification using CNN 

• Used convolutional Neural Net to classify images and analyzed its performance with variation in number of layers, kernel size etc. 

• LeNet-5 network architecture was used as a starting point. 

• Similar network and MLP network was used to classify DNA sequences.
